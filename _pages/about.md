I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Harvard University](https://seas.harvard.edu/). Prior to starting my Ph.D. I obtained my M.S. in Computational Biology and Quantitative Genetics at Harvard, advised by [Prof. Faisal Mahmood](https://faisal.ai/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Applied Biology with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Lawrence Chan](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/hti/people/academic-staff/dr-chan-lawrence-wc/), and [Prof. Songlin Chua](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/abct/people/academic-staff/dr-chua-song-lin/). 

My research interests include gigapixel computational pathology, representation learning, and multimodal integration.
