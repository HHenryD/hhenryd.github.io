I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Harvard University](https://seas.harvard.edu/).

Prior to starting my Ph.D. I obtained my M.Sc. in Computational Biology and Quantitative Genetics at Harvard, advised by [Prof. Faisal Mahmood](faisal.ai). Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Applied Biology with a minor in Applied Mathematics at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I was fortunate working with [Prof. Lawrence Chan](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/hti/people/academic-staff/dr-chan-lawrence-wc/), and [Prof. Songlin Chua](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/abct/people/academic-staff/dr-chua-song-lin/). 

I am currently interested in machine learning for healthcare, with a focus on representation learning for gigapixel computational pathology, natural langugae processing, and multi-modal data fusion.
